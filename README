For now this is just a collection of my fuel economy that I meticulously keep.  

I drive a 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek with a manual transmission.

EPA mileage is 23 / 30 for the manual transmission
EPA mileage is 25/ 33 for the CVT transmission

As you will no doubt notice my fuel economy is pretty bad compared to the EPA numbers.  Most of my driving is either in the city or in the mountains.  Additionally I am driving at elevations in excess of of 5400 feet (1600 meters), your mileage will vary and unless you also live in Colorado it will likely be better than mine.
